Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game that is often used to make quick decisions or settle disputes in a fun and random way. The game involves two players who simultaneously choose one of three options: "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors." The winner is determined based on the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same option, the game is a tie.
